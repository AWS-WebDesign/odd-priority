<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>graphics and web design elective. Each project progressivley adds more and more complex html and css elements, as the semester progresses</p>
<p>and we learn more about coding but more spacifically, HTML,CSS,and a little bit of JAVASCRIPT.</p>

<h2>Recurring Dream</h2>
<p>Recurring dream, Was our first graded project for Computer graphics</p>
<p>and web design, elective. For this project we used our newly accuired skills to </p>
<p>share a recurring dream that we have. This project was mostly just to practice basic HTML structure.</p>

<h2>GNU</h2>
<p>The Gnu website is to practice the basic html structure plus more, including background color</p>
<p>and a couple different class elements. For this project we were randomly given an animal to do research</p>
<p>about and to add to our new webpage.</p>

<h2>enviornmental Project</h2>
<p>During this project I learned how to add a video to a webpage. I also learned how to add</p>
<p>a border to the entire webpage and not just around a few words. The enviornmental project </p>
<p>was also our first project after learning how to make lists and un ordered lists in class.</p>

<p>The collection project was our first group project to be assigned for our class. </p>
<p>We were istructed to work together to try to find a common collectable item.</p>
<p>In the end we just chose a random object such as shells. During this project we worked to </p>
<p>make multiple pages with links and atleast one table.</p>

<h2>Buzzfeed Quiz</h2>
<p>As for the Buzzfeed Quiz project we had to learn about how to make a form which takes and holds information </p>
<p>to possibly eventually give a new product/ answer to the questions before.</p>
<p> Before starting the project we were allowed to search through all the buzzfeed quizzes to hopefully</p>
<p>find the perfect topic/outcome of our own quizzes. I chose where should you travel next?, as my question.</p>

<h2>Globalization project</h2>
<p>Our second group assignment was a project focusing on the problems and possitive things about the internet. </p>
<p>Me and my partner descided to focus mainly on the problem of globalization of the internet. </p>
<p>In this project we had to basically add in all of our knowledge that we had gained throughout the semester.</p>
<p>But most importantly our newist piece of knowledge being how to add animations to text and images. </p>
