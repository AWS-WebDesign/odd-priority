  <p> If you search up facts about fall, on every single website you will them talking about how
  <br> weight gain in the fall is very normal because of all the great foods around. Some may include
  <br>apples, sweet potatoes, squash, and anything involving pumpkins.
  <br>
  <br>One of the places to consider going to for some seasonal drinks could be starbucks. They always have many
  <br>different pumpkin flavored snacks and drinks. Other places to go for food could be some fall type
  <br>events in Tacoma or Seattle.
