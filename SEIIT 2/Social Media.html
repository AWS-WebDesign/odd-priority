<h2>Background of #Metoo movement:</h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>The Me Too movement (or #MeToo movement), with a large variety of local and
  international related names, is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual
  assault. The phrase "Me Too" was initially used in this context on social media
  in 2006, on Myspace, by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke.</p>

<h2>Impact of Social media:</h2>
<div class="text">
  According to Facebook, within a 24-hour period, over 4.7 million people worldwide had used the hashtag, and over 12 million posts, comments, and likes had been generated. The single tweet from Alyssa Milano has now received over 68,000 replies.
  And, even more fascinating, #MeToo truly went global. In Spanish, the hashtag became #YoTambien. In French, the hashtag became #balancetonporc. And there were various iterations in other languages as well, including different versions in the Middle East.
