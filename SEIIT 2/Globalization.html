  of the word "internet-working", and it was coined in the 70s to refer to the
  physical cables and puters all connected together.

    <h2>Relationship with Globalization</h2>
  According to  Ervin Laszlo, "Globalization is closely related to informatization. The exponentially growing
  networks of information and communication made possible the creation of
  international and transnational networks and associations, and many of these
  structures evolved into concrete business, governmental, or non-governmental
  organizations."

  <h2>Current impact</h2>
  Our society is a network society; that is, a society constructed around personal
   and organizational networks powered by digital networks and communicated by the
   Internet. And because networks are global and know no boundaries, the network
   society is a global network society. This historically specific social structure
   resulted from the interaction between the emerging technological paradigm based
   on the digital revolution and some major sociocultural changes.
